Play-blackjack
==============

Since I made a blackjack-scorer, I thought might as well continue to fully develop a game to play blackjack.

Rules:

1. Click 'start' to begin game, a pair of cards is issued

2. Choose to 'hit' or 'end'. 'Hit' will generate a new random card


How I made it on Javascript:

1. Code to calculate the total score given an array of cards, since this was the initial exercise I found

2. Code to generate random cards for player and computer

3. Code to generate a random card if player wants to hit, and computer cannot hit if greater than or equal to 17

4. Display initial card pair on page
