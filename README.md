Play-blackjack
==============

Since I made a blackjack-scorer, I thought might as well continue to fully develop a game to play blackjack.

Playable DEMO: http://buzzlightyear182.github.io/play-blackjack/

Whoever scores higher will be the winner. Score a 21 = Blackjack!

If player cards are higher than 21, dealer wins regardless of whatever dealer score is.


Rules:

1. Click 'Start' to begin game, a pair of cards is issued.

2. 'Hit' will generate a new random card. Dealer does not hit if score is 17 or higher.

3. 'Stand' will end the game and reveal score of dealer & player.

4. Clicking 'Start' again will begin another round, but keep record of your previous scores.

5. 'Reset' will clear the tally of scores and restart everything from scratch.
